  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">→ <strong>Bottom-Up (Tabulation)</strong> — iterative, fill DP table</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color:var(--primary); margin:1rem 0 0.5rem;">🎯 Must-Know DP Patterns</h4>

<h4 style="color:var(--primary); margin:1rem 0 0.5rem;">📝 5 Steps to Solve Any DP Problem</h4>
<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">1️⃣ Define the state — what does dp[i] mean?</li>
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">2️⃣ Write the recurrence relation</li>
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">3️⃣ Identify base cases</li>
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">4️⃣ Determine computation order</li>
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">5️⃣ Optimize space if possible</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color:var(--primary); margin:1rem 0 0.5rem;">💡 Pro Tips</h4>
<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">• Start with brute force → add memoization → optimize</li>
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">• Draw recursion tree to spot overlapping subproblems</li>
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">• Most 2D DP can reduce space from O(n²) to O(n)</li>
  <li style="padding:0.3rem 0;">• If you see "minimum/maximum/count ways" → think DP!</li>
